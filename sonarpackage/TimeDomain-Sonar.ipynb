    "\n",
    "In part II of the lab, we will be sending and receiving chirp pulses to estimate delays between the tranceived pulses. This is done by cross correlating / matched filtering the received signal with the known chirp pulse to detect the echoes. In this task, we will investigate the correlation properties of the chirp.\n",

    "$$ R_{xy}[n] = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^\\infty x[m]y^*[m-n] = (x[m]*y^*[-m])[n]$$\n",
    "\n",
    ", where $y^*[-m]$ is the complex conjugat of $y[-m]$. This similar to a convolution, without flipping one of the signals. It can be implemented using a convolution as shown above. In general, the more correlated the two signals is at position $n$, the higher the value will be. That's why it is useful in a sonar system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matched filter \n",
    "When we look for a very specific shape in a signal, we can comput a cross correlation between the signal and the shape we are interested in. In that case, the operation of the cross correlation is also called a matched filter -- i.e. correlating with a filter that is matched to the shape we look for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because we will be doing cross-correlations between a chirp pulse and its echoes, it is useful to look at the auto-correlation, which is basically a cross correlation of the signal with itself. A discrete autocorrelation of a signal is defined as: \n",
